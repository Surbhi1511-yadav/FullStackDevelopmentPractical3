    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript portion of website production as opposed to the database or server - side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.  </p>
